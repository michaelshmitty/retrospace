# What?
Retrospace is a place to learn and share knowledge about computers and
technology. A physical gateway to cyberspace, like a computer hobby club in the 80's and 90's.
Do you like to tinker with Linux or work on some (Arduino) micro-controller projects? Are you
interested in programming with C, Python or other languages? Wanna play some retro games and
reminisce about the good old NES and SNES days?
