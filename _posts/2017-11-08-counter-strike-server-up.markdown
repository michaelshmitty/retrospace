A couple of friends decided to relive the [Counter-Strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike){:target="_blank"} days of the
early nillies.
So we've set up a Counter-Strike 1.6 dedicated server at _cs.retrospace.be_
(standard port 27015). You need a valid copy of Counter-Strike. The easiest way to get one is [through the Steam store](http://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike/){:target="_blank"}
(multiple platforms supported) for â‚¬ 9.99.

To spice things up we have some bots in there as well as the infamous "Gun Game" mod.

Relive the past, join the fun!
